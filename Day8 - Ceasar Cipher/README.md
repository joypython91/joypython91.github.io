In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

Difference between teacher's and mine: <br>
I just wondering if someone goes typo, not encode or decode.<br>
In teacher's version, the program still going direction encode.<br>
But teacher's code read easily and mine maybe too long. <br>
Hope I can find better way to write it in the future!<br>
keep learning :D
